# Rebuild Score Sheet Reconciler through small verified slices

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

This is a hypothetical reconstruction exercise using the existing reference as a comparison point. Work on a practice branch or a separate scratch copy. Do not erase the working reference. Your goal is to recover the important decisions from requirements, not reproduce every character or configuration file from memory.

## Session zero: write a contract you can challenge

recordId identifies a score event; participantId identifies a person; name is a label. Scores are nonnegative safe integers when present. Null or omitted means missing, zero is recorded, conflicting names and duplicate events are rejected.

Your target skill is arrays, objects and accumulator reasoning. Write three examples before implementation: one ordinary success, one boundary distinction and one recovery or repeat sequence. Reuse the fixed reference fixtures only after making a prediction. If your new example is outside the documented scope, decide whether to reject it or explicitly expand the contract; do not let an incidental implementation choice decide silently.

Write a short non-goal list tied to this exercise. Non-goals keep an assistant from adding a database, a UI framework or a broad refactor before you understand the central rule. For static layout work, a meaningful non-goal may be scripting interactions that native HTML already handles. For stateful work, it may be remote persistence or a global state container.

## Slice 1: Name the three different facts

**Reference context:** A record identifies one observation. A participant identifies the person being summarized. A display name labels that person for humans. Start by writing these definitions before building the Map. The fixture intentionally contains two Sams to make a name-based implementation fail visibly rather than appear correct on an easy example.

### Your implementation route

1. Inspect `public/core.js` and the related adapter `public/app.js`. Write which responsibility belongs to each for this slice. A path is a place to inspect, not automatic permission to edit every file.
2. State the example independently: **p1 Sam: 4 and null → total 4; recorded 1; missing 1**. Explain which requirement supplies the expected answer.
3. Build the smallest version that can express the example. Start with explicit data and direct control flow. Introduce a helper only when you can name its input, output and reason to change.
4. Observe the result through the real boundary: a command, a browser control, or a layout condition. A function returning the right value does not prove a button passes it the right input.
5. Add a neighboring example that would fail if you special-cased the first one. Review your diff before comparing with the reference.

### Pause at the first uncertainty

Write the smallest question you cannot answer. It might concern ownership, a comparison operator, the effect of deleting a property, or when a callback actually runs. Include the exact expression and an example. Ask a mentor for one clue, then return to the source; avoid requesting a complete replacement implementation.

### Inspect an alternative

Choose one plausible different design for this slice. Describe the extra state, dependency or maintenance rule it introduces. If it satisfies the same contract, it is not automatically wrong. Compare the cost of making the next small change. If it violates the contract, provide the smallest concrete example that demonstrates that violation.

### Capture a reviewable stopping point

Record your actual check: npm test, plus the relevant real interaction or CLI observation. State what it established and what remains untested. Use a commit message about the resulting behavior rather than a list of file names. If the slice does not work yet, keep the uncertainty visible in the journal instead of writing a success narrative.

**Left for you:** the code, fixture values beyond the supplied example, exact naming and the acceptance evidence. The reference is available for comparison after an attempt; it is not evidence that your branch has passed.

## Slice 2: Accumulate one row at a time

**Reference context:** For every row, validate identity and score, create a summary only if the participant is new, then update either missing or recorded and total. Draw the Map after each row. This turns an accumulator into a sequence you can inspect rather than a compact expression whose correctness is hard to explain.

## Slice 3: Check totals as well as inputs

**Reference context:** Two individually safe integers can have a sum outside the safe range. The implementation checks the new total before storing it. This is a useful general lesson: validating each incoming field does not automatically prove an aggregate invariant. The reference rejects negative and decimal scores because this particular club’s scoring contract uses nonnegative whole points.

## Slice 4: Avoid stale tables after failures

**Reference context:** The UI clears its previous summary when a new fixture is chosen and before reconciliation. If a new sheet is invalid, it should not continue displaying an old table as if it belonged to the new input. The browser check exercises successful data followed by invalid and empty sheets, making this state transition observable.

## Reconstruct the whole path without the guide

r1 creates p1/Sam with total 4 → r2 creates a different p2/Sam with recorded zero → r3 increases p1 missing count → r4 adds 3 to p2 → r5 creates p3/Lee with a missing score.

Close this page and redraw that route from memory using your own labels. Open the code only to resolve a specific uncertainty. Then trace a different valid input and one boundary. If your picture requires a hidden value that you cannot locate in the source, investigate it; diagrams can invent state just as easily as prose can.

## Compare your implementation fairly

First compare behavior and evidence. Only then compare style and abstractions. A shorter implementation may be harder for you to explain; a longer implementation may duplicate a rule that later drifts. State the concrete tradeoff. Do not treat matching the reference line for line as the only successful outcome.

## Finish with a teach-back

Explain why `reconcileScores` is enough for its present responsibility, which work remains in `public/app.js`, and which future requirement would justify changing that boundary. Answer the original transfer question: What information is lost if you group by a nonunique name? Keep the answer short enough that another junior can challenge it with an example.
