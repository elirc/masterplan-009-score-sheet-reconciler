# M009: agentic engineering practice

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

These prompts are saved for you to run later with an assistant of your choice. They do not invoke a model, spend API credits or document a debate that already occurred. The core skill is controlling scope, supplying evidence and judging the result. More assistant messages do not automatically produce more understanding.

For this project, keep returning to this source-grounded model: Aggregation is a sequence of validated observations, not merely an addition. The event ID prevents counting one observation twice; the participant ID identifies whose summary changes; the name helps a human read it. Missing and zero contribute the same amount to total but convey different knowledge. Draw the accumulator after each row to keep those meanings visible.

## Prompt 01: Contract interviewer

**Prepare:** Paste the current contract and one example you cannot classify.

```text
Project: Score Sheet Reconciler. Main skill: Arrays, objects and accumulator reasoning.
Core reading anchor: public/core.js / reconcileScores.
Current contract: recordId identifies a score event; participantId identifies a person; name is a label. Scores are nonnegative safe integers when present. Null or omitted means missing, zero is recorded, conflicting names and duplicate events are rejected.
My own attempt, relevant source and observed evidence: [fill in].
I will describe the user outcome. Ask one question about an ambiguous boundary, then wait for my decision.
Stay within this repository and the selected exercise. Do not claim tests,
edits or external facts that you have not actually checked. End with one
small next action that I can perform and verify myself.
```

**Judge the response:** A useful reply exposes a choice; it does not silently add requirements.

Before accepting advice, restate it in your own words and predict its consequence for one existing example. If you cannot do that, request a smaller explanation instead of pasting a patch. Record whether the assistant gave a hypothesis, a proposed check or a verified observation; those are different kinds of contribution.

## Prompt 02: Source-reading tutor

**Prepare:** Paste a short source excerpt and your current explanation.

## A three-role review you can run later

Use a proposer, a challenger and an adjudicator as distinct conversational roles. The proposer states the contract and a small design. The challenger supplies counterexamples and costs. The adjudicator asks which claims can be tested and what the result would mean. These roles may be played by separate assistants or by people; agreement among them is not the acceptance criterion.

Start with the design question “Explain which identifier answers “who?” and which answers “which recorded event?”.” Give every role the same current source and constraints. Do not ask for hidden internal reasoning; ask for concise design rationales, assumptions, alternatives and evidence that you can inspect.

A useful round ends with one of three outcomes: retain the design with supporting evidence; change one bounded choice because a counterexample demonstrated a failure; or record an unresolved question and an experiment. Avoid endless argument over abstractions whose cost has not appeared in this small project.

## Keep execution separate from suggestion

If an assistant can edit files, first constrain the patch to your selected story and name the checks it should run. Inspect the diff afterward. If the assistant only gives text, do not copy its imagined terminal output into your verification record. Run the commands yourself and keep the real result.

## Reduce assistance over repeated attempts

First attempt: ask for one vocabulary hint. Second attempt: ask for a counterexample. Third attempt: implement a small variation without generated code and request only review. You may need more rounds for a difficult concept; the goal is honest progress toward independence, not pretending you needed no help.
