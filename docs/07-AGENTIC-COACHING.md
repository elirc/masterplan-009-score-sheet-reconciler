# Agentic coaching for M009

[Learning route](00-START-HERE.md) · [Journal](JOURNAL-TEMPLATE.md)

The goal is to get better at forming and testing technical judgments. An assistant can explain syntax, challenge examples and review a diff. It cannot supply your understanding merely by producing a convincing answer. Begin with a question or hint, then increase assistance only when you can inspect the result.

## Prompt 1 — a useful first reading

```text
I am learning arrays, objects and accumulator reasoning using Score Sheet Reconciler.
Here is the source of public/core.js: [paste the relevant small excerpt].
Here is my explanation of reconcileScores: [write your own explanation].
Ask one question that exposes a possible misunderstanding. Do not rewrite the code.
Distinguish what you can observe in the supplied code from what you are assuming.
```

Your explanation is part of the input, not an optional field. Without it, the assistant may give a generic lecture that does not address your misconception. Keep the excerpt small enough to trace and include the contract when a boundary value matters.

## Prompt 2 — clarify a feature before coding

```text
I am attempting practice story [number and title].
Current contract: recordId identifies a score event; participantId identifies a person; name is a label. Scores are nonnegative safe integers when present. Null or omitted means missing, zero is recorded, conflicting names and duplicate events are rejected.
My proposed new behavior: [fill in].
My happy-path example and edge case: [fill in].
My preferred design and one alternative: [fill in].
Challenge one ambiguous requirement. Give two possible interpretations and a
concrete input that distinguishes them. Leave the implementation to me.
```

Resolve the ambiguity yourself and write down the chosen interpretation. Do not treat an assistant's confident assumption as a product requirement. A good prompt includes a stop condition: one ambiguity or one hint, not an invitation to build an entire application.

## Prompt 3 — diagnose from evidence

```text
Expected result: [exact value or visible behavior].
Observed result: [what actually happened].
Reproduction: [smallest input and steps].
Current diff: [paste].
I think the owning rule is reconcileScores, because [reason].
Offer two hypotheses and one cheap experiment that distinguishes them.
Do not claim to have run a test. Do not edit unrelated files.
```

Run the proposed experiment yourself. Record whether it supported or rejected the hypothesis. If the assistant needs a missing file, provide the relevant content rather than accepting an invented description of that file.

## Prompt 4 — review a bounded patch

```text
Review this patch for practice story [number].
Acceptance criteria: [paste the story's concrete criteria].
Evidence I ran: [commands or browser steps and real results].
For each material finding, name the file/rule, give a reproducing input, and
explain which requirement would be violated. Separate proven failures from
hypotheses. Do not rewrite the project or add new scope.
```

Use a separate review conversation if you want a fresh challenge, but agreement among assistants is not proof. Resolve disagreement with the contract and a concrete experiment. An opinion about code style should not outrank a demonstrated wrong output.

## Prompt 5 — fade the help

```text
I think I understand this project. Ask me three questions, one at a time:
one execution trace, one boundary case, and one small design change.
Do not reveal the answer until I attempt it. If I am wrong, give the smallest
hint that helps me correct my explanation.
```

Afterward, make one small variation without generated code. In your journal, label what you wrote, what the assistant suggested and what you independently verified. These prompts are saved for future use; this repository does not claim they were executed or that multiple agents reviewed the build.
