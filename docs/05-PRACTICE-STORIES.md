# Six junior practice stories

[Debugging lab](04-DEBUGGING-LAB.md) · [Hints — use after an attempt](06-HINTS-AND-ANSWERS.md)

These are new exercises beyond the finished reference. No story is marked complete for you. Start a branch such as practice/story-01 and write acceptance examples before editing. Each plan leaves the actual code, wording and one design choice to you.

## Story 01: Add an average of recorded scores

**Feature boundary:** Derive average from total and recorded count without treating missing as zero-valued attempts.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `reconcileScores` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: A participant with no recorded scores has an explicit no-average state.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.
5. Reproduce the acceptance example and one existing boundary case. Add an automated regression for executable logic, or an explicit browser/keyboard/content observation for a static change.
6. Review the diff, explain the change without reading the solution, and record remaining limits.

**Acceptance evidence:** A participant with no recorded scores has an explicit no-average state.

**Left for you:** exact fixture values, names, wording, the implementation and the tradeoff decision. Do not open the hints until you have an example and a first attempt.

**Stretch only after completion:** add one adversarial example that a plausible but incorrect solution would fail. Explain why that example is more informative than adding three ordinary examples.

## Story 02: Sort summaries by total

**Feature boundary:** Return a new sorted summary array with a deterministic tie-breaker.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `reconcileScores` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: The input record order remains unchanged and equal totals have a documented order.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.
5. Reproduce the acceptance example and one existing boundary case. Add an automated regression for executable logic, or an explicit browser/keyboard/content observation for a static change.
6. Review the diff, explain the change without reading the solution, and record remaining limits.

## Story 03: Report incomplete participants

**Feature boundary:** Add a filter or badge for summaries with missing scores.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `reconcileScores` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: A zero-only participant is not mislabeled incomplete.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.

## Story 04: Add a team label

**Feature boundary:** Extend the fixture and decide how team identity is validated.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `reconcileScores` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: A conflicting team for one participant is handled by an explicit rule.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.

## Story 05: Change duplicate handling deliberately

**Feature boundary:** Explore ignoring exact repeated records while rejecting mismatched reuse of an ID.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `reconcileScores` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: Tests distinguish identical replay from conflicting data under the same ID.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.

## Story 06: Export a plain-text summary

**Feature boundary:** Format the completed summaries without changing reconciliation.

**Implementation plan:**

1. Trace `reconcileScores` and locate the smallest owning file from the code tour. Write how this story touches that responsibility.
2. Write a before/after example that demonstrates this acceptance requirement: The formatter handles empty input and preserves distinct participant IDs.
3. Choose the input shape, wording or layout policy yourself. Record one alternative and the reason you did not choose it.
4. Implement only the bounded change. If it crosses files, explain what each file owns rather than copying the same decision into several places.

## Additional planning checkpoints for stories 01–06

[Nine more stories, 07–15](11-NINE-MORE-STORIES.md) · [Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md)

Keep the original plans above. The following checkpoints add implementation and review depth without completing the exercise for you.

### Story 01 planning clinic: Add an average of recorded scores

**Before editing:** restate the boundary in your own words: Derive average from total and recorded count without treating missing as zero-valued attempts. Identify the part of `public/core.js` or `public/app.js` that owns it. If your proposed design changes another owner, explain the dependency instead of opening every file for a broad rewrite.

**Acceptance matrix:** write ordinary, boundary and repeat/recovery rows that establish “A participant with no recorded scores has an explicit no-average state.” Include exact starting data or content and the expected retained information. Calculate expected values or inspect meaningful source order independently of the proposed implementation.

**First implementation slice:** make only enough of the change to demonstrate one acceptance row. Inspect the diff and predict the next row before running it. If your first slice is mostly setup or abstraction with no observable result, consider a smaller direct route.

**Review challenge:** sketch a plausible wrong solution that would pass a casual demonstration. Choose a counterexample that exposes its specific weakness. Ask an assistant to critique that example rather than immediately asking it to finish the entire feature.

**Evidence and explanation:** use npm test, plus the relevant real interaction or CLI observation. Record the actual observation and the limit of the check. Finish by naming a design decision you made yourself and explaining why the neighboring original behavior still holds.

### Story 02 planning clinic: Sort summaries by total
